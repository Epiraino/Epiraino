### Hi, I'm Emilio ðŸ‘‹

A Passionate and Creative Backend Software Engineer. Previously I worked in property management working with a diverse group of clients. I have also worked in the 
backend of mortgage loan processing. I've always had a passion for building and optimising job functions and best practices in a creative way. My career persuit is to 
obtain a position as a Backend Developer for a global company. In my free time I enjoy training in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and currently a blue belt, this teaches me to have patience and to stay calm in stressful situations.
